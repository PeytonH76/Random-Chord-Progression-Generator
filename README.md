# Overview

This software is a random chord progression generator.
This program will ask the user for a root note and then ask the user for a length for the chord progression.
The code will then generate the random chords specified by the length of the chord progression. I made this software
mainly because I wanted to learn a little more about chords and chord progression. I wanted to learn how it works so I can
use it in the future. This idea also gave me more energy and interest in completing this project.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used a map to help store the keys and different chords that are in the music industry. I also used the cstdlib and ctime to 
create the random chord progression. I used the time to make sure the random generator is random everytime.
